Getting annoyed with not knowing all the answers to all of your questions?? Look no further, this magic eight ball knows everything. This was built using AJAX, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS. I used JavaScript to build an array of 20+ answers that are shown at random. The largest area of oppertunity that I faced while building this was, getting the answer to fit just right in the middle of the 8 ball. I was able to over come this challenge by placing the answer in the triangle on the HTML, and using pixles in order to get it in just the right place. Another area of oppertunity for me was getting the 8 ball to shake in a natural way. This was accomplished by using webkit keyframes, and animations.
